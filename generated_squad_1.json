    "context": "Bhairavanath temple is one of the temples that lies at the central of Bhaktapur, Taumadhi  Square and Bhairavanath Temple is built in the pagoda style and It is three-storey. It is one of the temple devoted to Lord Bhairava is one of the rectangular based temples of Bhaktapur. Curiously, there is no entrance on the temple's lengthy west facade that faces the square. Instead, priests access the interior from the south. The west facade is largely symmetrical and features a ground-level shrine with Bhairav depicted in miniature on a small metal throne. Michael Hutt notes that this small statue is frequently stolen and replaced. To either side of the deity are hammered copper plates depicting Bhairav's eyes, two pairs of hands, and two dogs and his faithful companions. At present, perhaps to discourage theft, the ground-level shrine is blocked from casual access by a makeshift wooden barricade.",
