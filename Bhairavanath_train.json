There are many stories as to why and how Lord Bhairav\u2019s head was cut off and worshipped here. According to legend, long ago, Kasi Bhairabnath  traveled to Nepal to view either the Bisket Jatra  or the Bal Kaumari Jatra. A tantric priestess in the crowd recognized him for what he was and attempted to immobilize him, but Vishvanath sought to escape by sinking into the ground. As his body descended into the earth, the priestess realized the god was her own husband. To prevent his escape, she ordered his head cut off where it protruded from the ground. Being a god, this was far from a fatal wound, and the priestess enshrined the head in the temple that now stands here. The body, meanwhile, returned to Benares whence it came. Dowman notes that a headless image of Bhairav is still worshipped there even today. Another story about this temple is also interesting, passed orally by our ancestors. According to this, the lord bhairava of Varanasi once visited Bhaktapur to see Bisket jatra. Bisket jatra is one of the biggest jatras of the newar people. During the festival, the lord Bhairava somehow was recognized by a priest and he just cast a decoy spell on him.  As a quick reaction, he started to sink into the terra firma to go back to Varanasi. But the priest didnot let him go. As if, he grabs the head of Bhairava in his hand and decollates him with his sword. That is why people say that the head doesnot match the body of Kasi Vishwanath. It is also believed that the head is still treasured in a box of this temple.",
